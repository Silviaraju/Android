SERVER MODULE
Need to use user-friendly disaster and emergency management system that includes a server and an accompanying website designed for disaster relief authorities, such as the concerned governmental agencies. The web portal enables governmental agencies to alert users immediately of emergencies as well as maintain the credibility of the alerts. That is because the web portal allows the agencies to view alerts about possible emergencies from users for further investigation about their seriousness. It also enables the notification of all users within the affected radius of an emergency incident. Web portal is required to update data on regular basis when there is an emergency.  Additionally, it is incorporated with a system to provide the user with the right course of action to be taken in case of several personal emergency cases, whether the user is experiencing it firsthand or just as a witness.


USER MODULE

Users have to download the application and access the application for the first time; the unique International Mobile Station Equipment Identity for the smart phone is stored in our server’s database. This is applied to distinguish each user, and set as his/her ID in our database. Location of the users are updated in real-time through the incorporation of GPS and pushed to the server. Only the users who are located within the region of the disaster or emergency are notified using push notifications or SMS, as appropriate. A wide range of users with different age groups can utilize the system for relief in various emergency situations; both on large and small scales that range from personal emergencies to community disasters at their time of occurrence. User can also alert the authority for any emergency situation also.


DMA MODULE
Once a crisis occurs, the concerned Disaster Management Authority (DMA), such as the local police, can locate the affected region on the map using the proposed accompanying web interface for governmental agencies. Alert will be issued with the local map to pin point the area / spot of incident and will be updated in server.


ACTION MODULE 
The aim is to provide the user with the right course of action to be taken in case of several personal emergency cases, whether the user is experiencing it firsthand or just as a witness. The users who are in the vicinity of the disaster receive real-time notifications either through push alerts or Short Message Service (SMS).
